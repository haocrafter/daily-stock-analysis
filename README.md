## üìä Strategy Overview

### **1. Mean Reversion Strategy**
Identifies stocks that have deviated significantly from their average price and are likely to revert:
- **Buy Signals**: Oversold conditions (low RSI, negative Z-score, below Bollinger lower band)
- **Sell Signals**: Overbought conditions (high RSI, positive Z-score, above Bollinger upper band)
- **Best For**: Range-bound markets, high-volatility stocks, contrarian plays

### **2. Momentum Strategy**
Identifies stocks with strong directional movement likely to continue:
- **Buy Signals**: Upward momentum (RSI > 50, MACD crossovers, positive ROC, price above MAs)
- **Sell Signals**: Downward momentum (RSI < 50, bearish MACD, negative ROC, price below MAs)
- **Best For**: Trending markets, breakout plays, trend-following

### **3. Combined Strategy**
Intelligently combines both approaches:
- **Consensus Signals**: Both strategies agree (highest confidence)
- **Momentum-Driven**: Momentum dominates with mean reversion support
- **Mean Reversion-Driven**: Mean reversion dominates with momentum confirmation
- **Contrarian Signals**: Strategies disagree (high risk/reward opportunities)

### **Key Algorithms**

#### **Mean Reversion Signal Calculation**
```python
def calculate_buy_signal_strength(data):
    # Combine multiple mean reversion indicators
    bollinger_signal = (close < bollinger_lower) * 0.3
    rsi_signal = (rsi < 30) * 0.25
    zscore_signal = (zscore < -2) * 0.25
    volume_signal = (volume > avg_volume * 1.5) * 0.2
    
    return min(sum(signals), 1.0)
```

#### **Momentum Signal Calculation**
```python
def calculate_momentum_signal_strength(data):
    # Combine multiple momentum indicators
    rsi_momentum = (rsi > 60 and rsi_prev <= 60) * 0.3
    macd_crossover = (macd > signal and macd_prev <= signal_prev) * 0.4
    price_momentum = (roc_5 > 5) * 0.2
    ma_alignment = (price_above_ma_count >= 3) * 0.1
    
    return min(sum(signals), 1.0)
```

#### **Combined Strategy Logic**
```python
def calculate_combined_signal(mr_signal, mom_signal):
    # Boost when both strategies agree
    if mr_signal > 0.5 and mom_signal > 0.5:
        return (mr_signal + mom_signal) / 2 * 1.2
    
    # Momentum breakout with mean reversion support
    elif mom_signal > 0.7 and mr_signal > 0.2:
        return mom_signal * 0.8 + mr_signal * 0.2
    
    # Individual strong signals
    elif max(mr_signal, mom_signal) > 0.6:
        return max(mr_signal, mom_signal) * 0.8
    
    return (mr_signal + mom_signal) / 2 * 0.6
```

## üìä Signal Interpretation Guide

### **Signal Strength Scale**
- **0.8 - 1.0**: Very Strong Signal (High Probability)
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Strong Signal (Good Probability)
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Moderate Signal (Medium Probability)
- **0.2 - 0.4**: Weak Signal (Low Probability)
- **0.0 - 0.2**: Very Weak Signal (Very Low Probability)

### **Strategy Types**
- **CONSENSUS**: Both mean reversion and momentum agree (Highest Confidence)
- **MOMENTUM**: Trend-following signals dominate (Good for trending markets)
- **MEAN_REVERSION**: Contrarian signals dominate (Good for range-bound markets)
- **CONTRARIAN**: Strategies disagree (High risk/reward, requires careful analysis)
- **WEAK**: Low signal strength across all strategies

### **Confidence Scores**
- **0.9**: High confidence (Both strategies agree)
- **0.75**: Medium-high confidence (Strong individual signals)
- **0.6**: Medium confidence (Moderate signals)
- **0.4**: Lower confidence (Contrarian signals)
- **0.3**: Low confidence (Weak signals)
