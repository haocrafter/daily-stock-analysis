# This file ensures the output/ directory is tracked by Git
# while all generated files within it are ignored.
# 
# The output/ directory is where all analysis results are generated:
# - CSV files with trading signals
# - PNG charts and visualizations  
# - HTML email reports
# - JSON data files
# 
# These files are environment-specific and should not be committed to Git.
